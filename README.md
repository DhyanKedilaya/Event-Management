# Event-Management
This is the event-management project built for the QuantumX hackathon held in New Horizon College of Engineering

The Code lies in the HTML,CSS and PHP file. To run the code correctly, just do the pre-requisite to make sure all the image url links in the html code are mapped to the correct image in the system.

Thank you for your time:)
